I wonder if there are not microscopic orchids growing on the motes of the air Saw big field of squashes throwing out their leafy tenticles to the wind preparing to catch the little fleeting atom for assimutation into its progeny the squash gourd— A spider weaves its net to catch an organized whole, how like this is the vegitable living plant, the leaves and stalk catch the primal free atom all an are then arranged in an organized whole. Heard a call from the house that sounded like the shreick of a lost angel, it was a female voice three sizes too small for the distance and was a call for breakfast— After breakfast laid down on a sofa, fell into light draught sleep dreamed that in the depth of space, on a bleak and gigantic planet the solitary soul of the great ==Napoleon=={Q517} was the sole inhabitant. I saw him as in the pictures, in

contemplative aspect with his blue eagle eye, amid the howl of the tempest and the lashing of gigantic waves high up on a jutting promontory gazing out among the worlds & stars that stud the depths of infinity Miles above him circled and swept the sky with ponderous wing the imperial condor bearing in his talons a message. Then the scene busted This comes from reading about Napoleon in Madame Recamiers memoirs. Then my dream changed Thought I was looking out upon the sea, suddenly the air was filled with millions of little cherubs as one sees in Raphaels pictures each I thought was about the size of a fly. They were perfectly formed & seemed semi-transparent, each swept down to the surface of the sea, reached out both their tiny hands and grabbed very small drop of water, and flew upwards where they assembled and appeared to form a cloud. This method of forming clouds was so different from the method described in Ganots Physic's that I congratulated myself on having learned the truth true method and was

Saw bugs, butterflies as varied as Prangs Chromos, Birds innumerable, flowers with as great a variety of color as Calico for the African market. Then to spoil the whole two poor miserable mortals came, who probably carry the idea that this world was created for them exclusively and that a large portion of the Creators time was specially devoted to hearing requests, criticisms and complaints about the imperfection of the natural laws which regulate this mud ball What a wonderfully small idea mankind has of the Almighty. My impression is that he has made unchangeable laws to govern this and billions of other worlds and that he has forgotten even the Existence of this little mote of ours ages ago. Why cant

Three several times the water broke loose from the iron grasp of gravitation and jumped on my 65 dollar coat But when one of the ladies got a small fragment of a drop on her dress orders were issued to make for port landed and

I do believe I have a big bump for Cookies. The first entry made by the recording angel on my behalf was for stealing my mothers cookies. 11 o'clock came and the pattering of many footsteps upon the stairs signalled the coming birth of silence only to be disturbed by the sonorous snore of the aimable Damon and the demonic laughter of the amatory family Cat.
